What I have problems with:
- Breaking freezes game and I can't continue (most likely my bios)
- Poking (SETMEM) doesn't stick
- After 35-40 dumps, xbox freezes, won't complete dump
- Hex Memory View will go blank if I search for a wrong address or is out of range (have re-dump to see it again)

What I'd like to see incorporated:
- A search/filter program (kind of like Art Money or Tsearch)... includes different searching/filtering of floats/Integers by 1,2,3,4,6,8,10 bytes;
  Unknown values (increased (by), decreased (by), did not change)
  Basically, figure out Art Money, then integrate it into XDKA (easier said then done, I know :P but it makes working a lot easier)
- Integrated Hex-Dec, Dec-Hex calculator (like Windows Calculator); Maybe include a base converter (32 bit, Intel) Basically Hexworkshop's base converter
- Maybe a visible buffer range in the Dumping Tag, for example: PC hex ranges: 2000000h-4000000h
- Customized dump button
- Automatic break point copy to Notes
- Change Xbox Logo
- Instead of the black background, maybe include a Evox-T logo in the background (something subtle so it doesn't overpower the text)
- Change logos next to "Dumping", "Notes"...etc to a more 3D look

If your hardcore (if not void this), then here is my "asking for too much" category:
- Incorporate a picture dumping tool (takes picture of current screen)
- ASM file maker (I'm too lazy to make a new .txt and save it as .asm)
- Timestamp/Title ID displayer (searches through XBE to find it)
- Incorporate Caustic's XBE-EXE converter

What I want to stay:
- PC-Xbox Xbox-PC hex converter
- GETMEM
- The "HUD" of course (shows what's happening between PC and Xbox)(Connecting, dump...etc)
- All the tabs
- Dumping (obviously)


What I never understood:
- What the "Section Flags" does
- Memory View (kind of pointless)
