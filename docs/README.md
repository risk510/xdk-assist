# What's in this folder?

This folder contains some documents I had that were related to XDK Assist. I've included them for posterity, but they aren't of much use practically speaking.

What_Hack0r_Complains_About_&_Wants.txt - At some point I polled Hack0r for a list of things he'd like to see improved in XDK Assist. This is that list. There's actually an unreleased XDK Assist v2 that began to implement some of these requests.

xdkassist.ini - The INI file that was bundled with a copy of XDK Assist I had. It demonstrates the configuration for the Tools system, ArtMoney offsets, etc.

xdkassist.notes - Notes from an unknown game I was debugging at some point.

xdkcmds.txt - Several XDK commands that can be issued over Telnet.
