# XDK Assist: What is XDK Assist?

XDK Assist is an application designed to allow you to easily communicate with an (original) Xbox in order to debug running applications. This was once the go-to application for creating trainers for modified Xbox systems.

The original XDK Assist was originally closed source software. It was a product of me being on the original EvolutionX team and creating custom tools for our work. It eventually evolved into something more robust and I released it to the public as-is. A few updates were released, but the project never had an official homepage or source of truth for downloads.

## How is this branch different?

The `2.x-dev` branch is different than the `master` branch in that it contains an unreleased version of XDK Assist. This version was a rewrite of the application to be more streamlined, faster, more stable, and remove a lot of cruft. Development of this version was never completed. It compiles and will run, but I do not remember what features were implemented beyond just having a UI. It doesn't look like the dump button is wired up, so functionality of this version is extremely limited. It's included for posterity.

# Why release the code so late?

I recently saw that some people are still using XDK Assist today even though it's been almost two decades since the original Xbox was released. Two decades ago I was a much different developer and wasn't so open to open sourcing my programs. Today, however, I'm all for it. I'm hoping release of this code might benefit the few folks out there who still use it. At a minimum it at least helps to preserve what I consider an important part of the Xbox homebrew scene.

# Requirements

* Delphi 2007 <https://www.embarcadero.com>
* Indy 10.1.1 <https://www.indyproject.org>
* A modded original Xbox with a debug bios loaded (i.e. EvoX)

I was able to get this to compile again under Delphi 2007 with Indy 10 that ships with Delphi 2007. You may be able to get it to compile with different versions of Delphi or Indy, but those are untested as well.

# Shoutouts

It's a bit juvenile but I still want to shout out to several of the folks I spent a lot of time reversing and developing software with. Some good times! I'm missing several folks but it's hard to remember screennames after so long.
